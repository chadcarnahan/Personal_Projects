Challenge Explanation:

Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

Intervals
Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.

CODE: 
def sum_of_intervals(intervals):
    l = []
    for i in intervals:
        l.append([*range(i[0],i[1])])
        
    l = [item for sublist in l for item in sublist]
    l = list(dict.fromkeys(l))
    
    return(len((l)))
